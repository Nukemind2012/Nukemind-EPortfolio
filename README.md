Q: How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

A: The most important thing for maintance is notes and easily/clearly defined code. I want to ensure that if I go back to the code in a year or two I fully undertsand what I was doing back then. I could use the CRUD Python module for many things- I may need to change something here or there but by and large it is almost plug and play. it is a very useful piece of code!




Q: How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

A; The first thing I did was read it, and read it very closely. The problem itself wasn't hard- the trick was making sure everything worked with locations and more. I tried to get it down one piece at a time then slowly make sure when completely done nothing interfered with anything else. When I build later databases I think the first thing I want to do is the dashboard itself- this is because by creating a dashboard I will be able to visualize any changes I make- and make sure they work- while when I am just working on it piece by piece I can't know it's working until it is fully plugged in.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists do a heck of a lot to say the least- they build and maintain databases, yes, but they also work on new programs, AI, LLM, games, archetcure, and more. I aim to be a Patent Lawyer- indeed this is my last semester before the patent bar. All of this will help me in that- understanding how clients build their programs, understanding how they think, means I will be able to better represent them.
